"""Use this node to extrude a curve profile along curves."""
:vimeo: Tutorial
    #id: 321386151

== Overview ==
#id: LYNX_fabric_thread_overview

Features:
* Extrude points around any arbitrary curve. All attributes that are needed for geometry creation will be created automatically if they don't exist.
* Introduce randomness to break up the look.

@inputs

Input 0:
    Feed in your curves, along which to extrude, here. All attributes that are needed for creating the geometry will be created automatically if they don't exist.
    
Input 1:
    Feed in your points, which create the curve profile, here. While you can feed in arbitrary points, it is recommended to use the [LYNX_fabric_thread_profile|Node:sop/LYNX--LYNX_fabric_thread_profile-1.1] node to generate them for more user control.

@outputs

Output:
   The threaded curve.


@parameters

== General ==
#id: LYNX_fabric_thread_general

Rest Frame:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_rest_frame
    Here you set the rest frame where the geometry is created. On all subsequent frames only the geometry data will be manipulated allowing for fast update times.
    :warning:
        If the input geometry point count changes write `$FF` as the parameters value. This way the geometry creation is done at every frame at the cost of performance. 

Transfer Attributes:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_attribute_transfer_toggle
    With this you can toggle the transfer of the attributes from incoming geomeotry onto the curve geometry.
        
== Fiber ==
Fiber settings refer to settings per actual output curve. The term `fiber` is synonymous with the term `output curve`.

=== General ===
Automatically Resample Fiber:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_thread_fiber_general_resample
    This auto resamples the input curves to account for the [Twist Cycles|#LYNX_fabric_thread_thread_twist_twist]. The `Segments Per 360` parameter controls how many segments are created for every 360 twists.
    :warning:
        When enabling this the resampling only takes the thread twist settings into account and not the fiber twist settings when calculating the resample density.
Detangle Fiber:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_thread_fiber_general_detangle
    Detangle the curves after they have been extruded around the input curves. Higher iterations yield better results. The detangling is only done on the [Rest Frame|#LYNX_fabric_rest_frame]. 
Smooth:
    Smooth out the curves. This can be handy when using the [Detangle Fiber|#LYNX_fabric_thread_fiber_general_detangle] toggle to smooth out areas where there was a lot of penetration.

=== Twist ===
These settings control how each output curve is twisted around the orginal curve.

==== > Randomize ====
Randomize the twist cycles and twist offset per fiber. This is useful to break up the look and to introduce irregularities. Using small values is recommended.

Seed:
    Sets the seed per fiber used for generating a random value between 0 and 1.
Min/Max:
    Remaps the random value to this range and multiplies it with the twist cycle count / adds it to the twist offset.

=== Offset ===
These settings control how each output curve is offset to the orginal curve.

Offset:
    The offset multiplier for the offset along the input curves.
Offset Along Fiber:
    The offset remapped along the uv of the input curves.
    
==== > Randomize ====
Randomize the offset distance per fiber. This is useful to break up the look and to introduce irregularities.

Seed:
    Sets the seed per fiber used for generating a random value between 0 and 1.
Min/Max:
    Remaps the random value to this range and multiplies it with the offset.
    
==== > Noise ====
Introduce noise to the offset distance along the uv of each individual fiber. This is useful to make the look more organic.

Scale/Offset:
    Scales/Offsets the noise along the uvs.
Min/Max:
    Remaps the random value to this range and multiplies it with the distance offset.
    
== Thread ==
Thread settings can be thought of the settings per input curve. A single thread is the curve profile extruded around one of the input curves.

=== Twist ===
These settings control how the whole curve profile is twisted around the orginal curve.

Cycles:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_thread_thread_twist_twist
    Number of 360° twists around the input curves.
Offset:
    This offsets the twist of the whole thread around the input curves.    

==== > Randomize ====
Randomize the twist cycles and twist offset per thread. This is useful to break up the look and to introduce irregularities.

Seed:
    Sets the seed per fiber used for generating a random value between 0 and 1.
Min/Max:
    Remaps the random value to this range and multiplies it with the twist cycle count / adds it to the twist offset.
    
==== > Scale ====
Apply Scale After Twist:
    If a scale attribute is present on the input curves, this will influence if the scale attribute is applied before or after the twist. This can be useful for "flat" threads.
