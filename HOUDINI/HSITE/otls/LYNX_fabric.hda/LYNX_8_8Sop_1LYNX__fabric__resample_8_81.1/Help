== Overview ==
#id: LYNX_fabric_resample_overview

Features:
* Intelligently resample you curves either via bounding geometry or group selections. 
* Supports the `segment_length` attribute to allow for gradient like density resampling. See [Resample Length|#LYNX_fabric_resample_fiber_resample_length] for more info.

@inputs

Input 0:
    Feed in curves here. All attributes that are needed for creating the geometry will be created automatically if they don't exist.
    
Input 1:
    Feed in bounding box geometry when using the [Geometry|#LYNX_fabric_resample_fiber_resample_mode] mode.

@outputs

Output:
   The resampled curve.


@parameters

== General ==
#id: LYNX_fabric_resample_general

Rest Frame:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_rest_frame
    Here you set the rest frame where the geometry is created. On all subsequent frames only the geometry data will be manipulated allowing for fast update times.
    :warning:
        If the input curve point count changes write `$FF` as the parameters value. This way the geometry creation is done at every frame at the cost of performance. 

== Fiber ==

=== General ===
Mode:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_resample_fiber_resample_mode
    Select which primitives should be resampled.
    There are two modes:
    * `Geometry`: Everything inside the bounding geometry from the second input is resampled. You can use the `Combine Geometry` toggle to boolean combine the geometry before calculating the bouding geometry point group.
    * `Group`: This allows you to feed in point groups or point selections.  
Resample Length:
    #id: LYNX_fabric_resample_fiber_resample_length
    The length of each curve edge. If the `resample_length` attribute is present it will override the resample length parameter to allow for custom resamples.
    :warning:
        Since only existing edges are resampled make sure your curves are sufficiently subdivided beforehand to create resamples with a gradient like point density. 
Invert:
    Inverts the selection.
Keep If Resolution is:
    Only keeps the curve if the resampled point count is either `Higher`/`Changed`/`Lower` than the original curve. This is evaluated per curve.
